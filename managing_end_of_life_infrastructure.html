          It is no news that every business must have infrastructure put in
          place for the smooth running of operations. However, being equipped
          with the right infrastructure may not guarantee total sustainability
          and maximum productivity if management is not in place. Perhaps, the
          most critical concern is how you manage end-of-life infrastructure.
          Thus, this article presents a laconic explanation of how to manage
          end-of-life infrastructure to guarantee business continuity. Enjoy the
          read.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>What Do I Mean By End-of-Life Infrastructure?</b><br /><br />
          In this context, I am referring to IT Infrastructures which means the
          combination of the hardware, software, pieces of equipment,
          facilities, and other components that aid in the successful delivery
          of the service operations offered by a business or a firm. In simpler
          terms, IT Infrastructures are the foundational resources or say a
          framework that keeps the business in operation. They may otherwise be
          called supportive systems because they control the flow of storage,
          processing, and analysis of the business data & insights. Some of
          these IT infrastructures may include servers, cloud storage
          facilities, network hubs, data centres, workstations, potential
          software, routers, cables, Internet facilities, hardware like printing
          machines, connecting devices, network security devices, Operating
          systems, and even Computer systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b> So, How Do You Manage End-of-Life Infrastructure?</b><br /><br />
          Having understood the essence and the value of Infrastructures, It is
          required to now understand how to manage these Infrastructures at
          their end of life. Several businesses have suffered the implications
          of not paying attention to the management of these infrastructures at
          their end-of-life. Please do not miss the following points:
        </p>

        <ul class="mt-5 mb-5">
          <li>
            Prepare a plan that helps you manage the lifecycle of these
            infrastructures.
          </li>
          <li>Continuous backup of OS and data</li>
          <li>Conduct frequent inspections of infrastructure.</li>
          <li>Take inventory of the entire business assets.</li>
          <li>Monitor the performance of devices constantly.</li>
          <li>Maintain constant security protocols.</li>
          <li>Review the ethical and standard compliance occasionally.</li>
          <li>
            Hire a professional to effectively manage your infrastructure.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-center">
          Emphasising the last point above, many businesses have found
          themselves in hot water over their negligence in managing end-of-life
          infrastructures. To avoid being in the same tragedy, it is highly
          recommended to partner or hire professionals who are conversant in
          that area. DeployedITSolutions is a reputable IT firm that helps
