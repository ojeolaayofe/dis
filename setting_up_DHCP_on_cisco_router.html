          The primary focus of this article lies in helping you understand how
          to set up DHCP on Cisco Routers. But before that, you need to first
          get into what DHCP really means.<br /><br />What is DHCP? DHCP stands
          for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol. It's a network protocol that
          automatically assigns IP addresses and other network configuration
          information to devices on a network, allowing them to communicate with
          each other.<br /><br />
          For more clarity, Imagine DHCP as a helpful coordinator at a party.
          When you join the party (network ), DHCP hands out unique name tags
          (IP addresses) to everyone in the party (each device on the network),
          so communication can become easier without confusion. I am sure you
          agree that this eventually saves everyone from manually figuring out
          who's who on the network.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>What are CISCO Routers?</b><br />
          A router simply connects different networks. If a router is connected
          to a network, hosts of the network use the router as the default
          gateway to reach the host of other networks. Cisco routers are a
          product line of network devices designed and manufactured by Cisco
          Systems, a leading networking hardware and telecommunications
          equipment company. These routers serve as the backbone of many
          networks, enabling the interconnection of various devices and
          facilitating the flow of data between them. They often include various
          features such as security protocols, Quality of Service (QoS)
          controls, and support for different network protocols, making them
          widely used in enterprise and service provider environments for
          building and managing networks.

            ><b>The Process of Configuring DHCP on CISCO Routers.</b></span
          ><br />
          Configuring DHCP on a Cisco router involves several steps to ensure a
          seamless and efficient network. Here is a detailed process<br /><br />
          1. <b>Access the CISCO Router</b><br />
          The first thing to do is to access the Cisco router. Begin by
          accessing the router's Command Line Interface (CLI). It's a text-based
          interface used for entering commands to interact with a computer or
          software. In the context of networking devices like Cisco routers, CLI
          allows users to configure settings by entering commands
          manually.Accessing the CLI can be done using a console cable or by
          establishing a Telnet/SSH connection. After connecting, log in using
          the correct credentials. The next thing to do is to access Global
          Configuration Mode by typing ‘enable’ followed by ‘configure
          terminal'. This grants you access to the router's configuration
          settings.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. <b>Configure the Router Interface</b><br />
          Configuring the Router Interface is the next step to take. Determine
          the interface that will receive DHCP requests. Access the interface
          configuration mode using commands like ‘interface GigabitEthernet0/0’.
          After which you enable DHCP. Navigate to DHCP Configuration mode by
          typing ‘ip dhcp pool ’. Then you define the DHCP pool parameters such
          as network, default gateway, DNS servers, and lease duration.For
          instance: Router config #ip dhcp pool Floor DHCP Router(dhcp-config)#
        </p>
        <p>
          3. <b>Configure Lease Duration</b><br />
          Specify the lease duration for IP addresses using the command:
          ‘lease ’. This determines how long an IP address is assigned to a
          device. If you do not specify this argument, the default lease time of
          24 hours will be used. Also, prevent specific IP addresses from being
          assigned by configuring exclusions. Use the ‘ip dhcp
          excluded-address ’ command.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. <b>Verify DHCP Configuration</b><br />
          After configuration, use the ‘show ip dhcp pool’ command to verify
          settings and check allocated addresses with ‘show ip dhcp binding’.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. <b>Save Configuration</b><br />
          Save the configuration changes by entering ‘write memory or copy
          running-config startup-config’. This basic setup creates a DHCP pool,
          defines parameters, assigns DHCP to an interface, and eventually saves
          the configuration. You may also adjust the details based on your
          network requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. <b>Testing DHCP</b><br />
          Connect a device to the configured interface and check if it obtains
          an IP address automatically. Troubleshoot using the ‘debug ip dhcp
          server events’ command if needed.
        </p>
        <p class="text-center">
          Finally, configuring DHCP on a Cisco router is a multi-step process
          which is crucial for effective IP address assignment in a network.
          Adhering to this guide will enable you to establish DHCP seamlessly
          and uphold the functionality of your network infrastructure. Please
          keep in mind that the commands and configurations mentioned above
          might differ depending on your router model and software version.You
          may consult Cisco's official documentation for model-specific
          information or alternatively, hire an experienced professional such as
