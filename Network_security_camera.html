          A popular question we have frequently received at DeployedItSolution
          is “Are security cameras connected to a network?” In, this article, we
          aim to discuss network security cameras and the role of a Network
          Technician. This article also succinctly discusses the merits of
          cameras and highlights a few recommendations for businesses. Read with
          me, don’t miss out!<br /><br />
          In this new age of technology, businesses can now employ the use of
          video surveillance technology to serve as a crime deterrent. Several
          decades ago, Security cameras were usually placed in a dormant
          position which is not fully efficient as a tool for monitoring
          business assets. In recent times, these obsolete cameras are now being
          replaced with modern sophisticated Cameras such as Network Security
          Cameras or simply called IP Cameras.<br /><br />It is the job of a
          Network Technician to install and configure these cameras. A Network
          Technician further analyse and troubleshoots these cameras when they
          are at fault. Furthermore, images, recordings, and videos recovered
          from these security cameras are seamlessly deployed on the cloud with
          the expertise of a Network Technician. The data received such as
          footage are often streamlined through a network so that it may be
          accessible when you need them.<br /><br />
          The security feeds can also be remotely retrieved and accessed in
          real-time simultaneously from different locations and multiple users
          thereby providing a more enhanced, comfortable and flexible way of
          monitoring your businesses or other physical properties. Hence, the
          use of IP Cameras is a reliable security tool for your business and as
          such highly recommended.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using IP Cameras does not require many resources, all that is needed
          include the camera(s), network cables, a network video recorder, and
          some specific network devices. However, the installation part is a
          very tedious task and may require the services of professionals.<br /><br />Our
          team of skilled and experienced Network Technicians can provide your
          business with excellent indoor & outdoor CCTV Camera Installation and
          other top-notch surveillance services needed by your business, we can
          also help you review the best type of Cameras suitable for your
          business. DeployedITSolution (DIS) is a reputable IT firm that has
          helped hundreds of businesses and organizations improve their security
          experience by carefully setting up robust surveillance systems to
          ensure their business continuity. DIS is the leading firm when it
          comes to networking security cameras.<br /><br />
          <b>Benefits of Network Security Cameras </b><br /><br />
          Do you agree with me that the protection of personal and business
          assets has received more attention in the past decade? Therefore, IP
          Cameras are a must-have tool for emerging businesses. Perhaps, this is
          a significant reason for the rapid increase in the jobs of Network
          Technicians. Here are some of the benefits of installing Network
          Security or IP Cameras for your business.
        </p>

        <ul class="mt-5 mb-5">
          <li>
            There is no limit to the usage of IP Cameras that can be installed
            in any of your business outdoor or indoor spaces.
          </li>
          <li>
            IP Network Systems offer better and high-quality resolutions since
            they use modern technology.
          </li>
          <li>
            With the use of the Camera’s IP addresses, you can easily access
            camera footage of your business place remotely from anywhere in the
            world.
          </li>
          <li>
            IP cameras do not only recognize objects and persons, they also
            detect motions and can even be automated to produce warning sounds
            whenever there is a likely breach.
          </li>
          <li>
            Configuration is not expensive and takes no time which makes it
            faster for you to start seeing what happens exactly when it happens.
          </li>
          <li>
            Network Security Cameras can be deployed to be compatible with
            existing network systems that are already configured in your
            business space.
          </li>
          <li>
            IP cameras are manufactured to ideally comply with regulatory
            standards such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
          </li>
          <li>
            Network Security Cameras have been tested to be durable and they
            last for a long time. They are also resistant to water, spillages,
            rust, and fire.
          </li>
          <li>
            They are automatically enabled to remain functional during the night
            and in total darkness.
          </li>
          <li>
            They are equipped with sufficient storage capacity and can also be
            deployed to the cloud storage as well.
          </li>
        </ul>
