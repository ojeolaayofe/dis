          Customer satisfaction plays a legendary role in the growth of
          businesses, especially if the business is propagated by Cloud-based
          platforms. Hence, business owners must pay attention to the effects or
          influence of Cloud scalability. In simpler terms, Cloud scalability is
          necessary for businesses to meet their client demand. In the previous
          article, we discussed how to leverage Cloud services on businesses. In
          this read, you will learn the association between customer
          satisfaction and Cloud scalability. Read with me!
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Relationship Between Cloud Scalability and Customer Satisfaction</b
          ><br /><br />
          Cloud Scalability is similar to the concept of Cloud Availability and
          Cloud Reliability in the sense that Cloud Availability means ensuring
          that your cloud services are accessible to your customers all the time
          while Cloud Reliability means assuring that the services your business
          offers are of top quality and meet customer expectations. Perhaps, you
          would agree with me that Cloud Scalability refers to the ability of a
          cloud service provider to adapt your business on the cloud to changing
          demands.
        </p>
        <p>
          Consider a scenario where you have expected between 500 and 700 daily
          purchases, say on an e-commerce website. This insinuates that you have
          allocated about 700 resources on the cloud to process a check-out
          order for each customer. Imagine, a slight increase to about 900
          purchases, the effect will cause the website to experience intense
          traffic which may result in low response time, failure to load the
          site, and ultimately affecting customer experience. To solve this,
          Cloud Scalability helps your business to scale up automatically by
          allocating new resources to accommodate the new changes. Hence, helps
          your business achieve customer satisfaction. Similarly, Cloud
          Scalability automatically scale down the resources if the orders are
          not up to the expected amount. This is done to save resources on the
          cloud and also helps the business to manage costs. It is your
          responsibility as a business owner to ensure that the varying changes
          in customer demands do not affect or interrupt the services hosted on
          the cloud platforms. If it does happen, this may eventually result in
          low customer engagement, diminished credibility, lack of trust, poor
          service delivery and ultimately destroy the business proceeds.

            <b> What More Do You Not Know?</b><br /><br />

            Cloud Scalability is paramount when discussing Cloud computing. This
            makes it possible for cloud service providers to be equipped with
            the appropriate hardware or software to host your services on the
            cloud. Furthermore, Cloud Elasticity which is a type of Cloud
            Scalability empowers your business by allowing you to add resources
            or remove resources appropriately via a Virtual Machine. You can
            achieve Cloud Scalability through Horizontal Scaling. Vertical
            Scaling, and Diagonal Scaling. There are a number of factors to
            consider when powering your business services on the Cloud. You
            might want to make sure all of the following are in place.<br /><br />

            <li>
              Monitoring your services to confirm they are up and running.
            </li>
            <li>
              Testing that your cloud services are accessible from distant
              locations in any part of the world.
            </li>
            <li>Establishing a secured connection to increase reliability.</li>
            <li>Deploying the right products or services on the cloud.</li>
            <li>Identify faults quickly through Visualization.</li>
            <li>Proper planning of resources to reduce maintenance costs.</li>
          </p>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-center">
          <b>What To Do Next?</b><br /><br />
          It is arguable that business owners may not have ample time to monitor
          their cloud services efficiently by themselves. Hence, the best
          alternative is to request the service of a reputable company that is
          professional in that field. If your business falls in this category,
          you may want to establish contact with our service department.
